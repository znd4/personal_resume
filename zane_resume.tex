		I am a software engineer with a background in analytics and machine learning. I'm a huge fan and advocate of python, but I love learning new frameworks and languages (currently golang and lua). As a senior software engineer, I'm equally comfortable leading high-level architecture discussions, pairing with junior devs, and debugging annoying bugs.

		As the technical lead of the model-training-as-a-service product team within Ford's Mach1ML platform organization, I drove adoption of modern python development tools (poetry/pipenv, black, pre-commit, tox, etc.). Advocated the replacement of flask with fastapi for REST API development -- contributed a fastapi template to Ford's project bootstrapping tool. Implemented faster process for the approval of open-source python packages. Worked with tech leads for other product teams to plan inter-team integrations. Led the early development and design of the platform's python SDK. Worked hands-on with internal customers to onboard production Machine Learning use-cases.
