		I am a versatile software / ML engineer with over 5 years of experience specializing in software development and machine learning. I'm currently attempting to upskill to be able to contribute to AI Safety research. Experienced in Python, I have moderate experience with Golang and Lua. As a senior engineer, I excel in leading high-level architectural discussions, mentoring junior developers, and solving complex issues.
