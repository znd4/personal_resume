		I am a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Software Development and Machine Learning. I'm a huge fan and advocate of python, but I love learning new frameworks and languages (currently golang and lua). As a senior engineer, I'm equally comfortable leading high-level architecture discussions, pairing with junior devs, and debugging problematic incidents.

		\textbf{Aspiration Inc}
		\newline
		Senior Software Engineer - Backend \newline
		Remote \newline
		January 2022 - Present
	}{
		Developed shared libraries and consumer+business-facing backend services.
		This included working with go, kubernetes, terraform, and multiple AWS services.
		Implemented a circleci orb for installing and running \code{pre-commit} hooks to enforce code quality standards.
		Added end-to-end tests to our serverless functions, thereby ending a series of incidents where broken lambda configurations made it through our CI to deployment.
		Improved application observability; integrated Datadog distributed tracing \& logging.
		On multiple occasions, used snowflake queries to determine the cause and impact of production incidents.

		February 2020 - January 2022
	}{
		As the technical lead of the model-training-as-a-service product team within Ford's Mach1ML platform organization, I drove adoption of modern python development tools (\code{poetry}/\code{pipenv}, \code{black}, \code{pre-commit}, \code{tox}, etc.). Championed the replacement of \code{flask} with \code{fastapi} for REST API development by adding a \code{fastapi} wrapper to the team's project bootstrapping tool. Significantly sped up the process for the review \& approval of pypi packages. Worked with other tech leads to plan cross-team integrations. Led the early development and design of the platform's python SDK. Worked hands-on with internal customers to onboard production Machine Learning use-cases. Mentored a large team of (~10) junior developers \& data scientists, with an eye towards documenting the solutions to recurring issues.

		November 2017 - February 2020
	}{
		Developed likelihood-to-purchase models for tens of millions of consumers. Helped the team adopt Github for version control. Created and distributed a python package to streamline the process of instantiating a pyspark driver on Ford's High Performance Computing cluster. Drove adoption of test-driven-development and static code analysis for our python libraries and flask services.

		June-September 2017
	}{
		While working in the Disney Imagineering Media and Art Pipeline group, I developed software used for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_mapping}{projection mapping} in Disney's parks and resorts. I built a continuous integration system for multiple interdependent applications which were used for different parts of the projection mapping pipeline.

		Santa Clara, CA\newline
		February-August 2016
	}{
		During this six month internship at Intel, I worked on a desktop application for technicians to work with manufacturing robots. While on the team, I added an exception-handler and a sqlite-based logging system for tracking test metadata. This was the first time I worked in a large code base and learned to write maintainable code.
